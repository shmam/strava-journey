# Strava-Journey ⛰️
Strava Journey is an experiment meant to explore what stringing together multiple strava activities could look like as a single "journey"!Think about a journey as a multi-day backpacking trip or a bikebacking expedition across the country. You can vizualize your cumulative stats and a stitched together map 🗺️

Feel free to login and let me know what you think! I'm open to any and all feedback and would love to see this in the app @strava 😉
